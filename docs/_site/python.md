# Learning Python

## Using this course

The primary purpose for this course is to be able to complete the following 7 assignments:

1. [Functions](https://github.com/nandans-summer-camp/learning-python-functions){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
2. [Conditionals](https://github.com/nandans-summer-camp/learning-python-conditionals){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
3. [Loops](https://github.com/nandans-summer-camp/learning-python-loops){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
4. [Dictionaries](https://github.com/nandans-summer-camp/learning-python-dictionaries){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
5. [Classes](https://github.com/nandans-summer-camp/learning-python-classes){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
6. [JSON](https://github.com/nandans-summer-camp/learning-python-json){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
7. [Test](https://github.com/nandans-summer-camp/learning-python-test){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

To help you complete the assignments, you will find a set of recorded lectures below that introduce you to the concepts needed. Along with the videos, you will find a link to the slides in HTML format. You can also find a PDF version of the slides [in this Github respository](https://github.com/barcelonagse-datascience/learning-python){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

## Optional Pre-course Materials

#### Udacity

If you have very little programming experience, it can be helpful to walk through the basics with an online, interactive interface. There are many of these online, but the following is free and reasonable:

* [Udacity Introduction to Python Programming](https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-python--ud1110){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

You should only need to complete lessons 1-2 to be ready to continue with our assignments.


&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## 0. Introduction to Python + Variables

This module has no assignments, but gives a brief introduction to Python and shows how variable assignment works in Python. If you feel you need exercises with the basics of variable assignment, please take a look at the Udacity course listed above.

## 1. Functions and Catching Exceptions

This module introduces the two most fundamental building blocks for building programs in Python: functions and exceptions. **[Assignment!](https://github.com/nandans-summer-camp/learning-python-functions){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**

## 2. Conditionals and Raising Exceptions

This module introduces control flow (`if`, `elif`, `else`, etc.) and shows us how to use control flow to raise our own exceptions when things don't look as expected. **[Assignment!](https://github.com/nandans-summer-camp/learning-python-conditionals){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**

&nbsp;
## 3. Lists and Loops

This module introduces the basic building blocks for iterating in Python: the list and the for loop, as well as three basic patterns for working with lists: map, filter, reduce. **[Assignment!](https://github.com/nandans-summer-camp/learning-python-loops){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**

&nbsp;
## 4. Tuples and Dictionaries

This module introduces two important data structures, the Tuple and the Dictionary, and introduces patterns for working with lists of tuples and lists of dictionaries. **[Assignment!](https://github.com/nandans-summer-camp/learning-python-dictionaries){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**

## 6. Modules and JSON

This module includes information about working with modules and loading JSON data: an important data serialization format that fits well with the type of data we've been working with so far. **[Assignment!](https://github.com/nandans-summer-camp/learning-python-json){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**

## 7. Test

This assignment brings everything we've been working on together to give you more practice. You can think of it like an "exam", you should be able to complete it in a reasonable amount of time (5 hours). **[Test!](https://github.com/nandans-summer-camp/learning-python-test){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**
