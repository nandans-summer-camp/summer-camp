# Nandan's Summer Camp

This is a collection of material I've created over the years to teach Python, Pandas, and basic Data Warehousing.

It consists of several modules. Each module consists of various lectures and assignments. The lectures are recorded in videos and the assignments consist sometimes of python files and tests, other times of Jupyter notebooks, other times as instructions that you need to complete. 

All the assignments are created in separate repositories such that they can be used as templates for Github Classroom assignments. If you are teaching a class and want to use the material, you can directly create assignments from the public repositories and assign them to students, allowing for an easy way to give feedback.

Enjoy!
