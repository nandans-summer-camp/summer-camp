# Pandas

Pandas is cool. Unfortunately I don't yet have videos for these assignments. There are also no slides, each repository has a notebook (or notebooks) which combine markdown and code to teach a certain topic. After going through that notebook, either as a teacher or as a student self-guided, one should then do the corresponding `assignment.ipynb` notebook.
