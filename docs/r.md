# Learning R

R is cool. Unfortunately I don't yet have videos for these assignments. 

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## 1. Introduction to R

Just take the intro on Datacamp, it's not terrible. 

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## 2. Functions and Classes

You will just need R and a text editor or IDE (i.e. R Studio). Instructions are in the exercises file. There is a solutions branch!
